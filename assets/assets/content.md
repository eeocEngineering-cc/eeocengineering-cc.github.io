# BUZZER QUICK START/INFO

## 1.
- Order Matters. Each buzzer must be plugged in in the proper place to function correctly.
- Each buzzer has a "map" showing where it belongs in relation to the center control box.

## 2.
- Use the map on each piece to line up all the buzzers beside the center box.
- The big square represents the center box, and the solid white box shows where the individual buzzer belongs.

## 3.
- Plug the 2-ft cords between each box in the row and use the longer cord for the remote clear button.
- Connect the power cord and play a game!
